# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

It requires a working Python interpreter to be installed at your command line.

The BookBot application takes books stored as text (.TXT) files  and produces stats such as total character count, total word count and the frequency of each letter in the book.

To use the application, download this repo and then browse to the path of the repo.

From there, go to the command line and type "python3 main.py <path of your book>", and wait for the onscreen report to be generated.

Have fun!
